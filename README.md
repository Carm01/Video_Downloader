# Video_Downloader
A GUI that uses the youtube-dl.exe as the engine to download videos or audio. Currently this uses the youtub-dl.exe as the engine that gets the vidio and/or audio. This currently is not meant to convert video or audios after the fact and does not use any FFMPEG.exe or anything else.

The purpose of this is to make it simple for people to get the content they want as everyone does not know how to use command line switches. Let face it who wants to mess around with command line all the time when you can copy/paste a link into a box and press two buttons to get your content?

This is definatly not meant to replace youtube-dl.exe, just an alternate way to get the content and still use a FREE open source utility. The ability to download or not download content depends on the youtube-dl.exe, so do not complain if something does not download or whatever.
